Simplistic version of a well known game written in Java. The game logic lives almost entirely in the model where it can be unit tested extensively. The techniques used in this project (e.g. the use of a DSL in the tests) are taught as part of our 'Engineering Principles Training'

This is a standalone Eclipse project, devoid of a maven pom but containing a small handful of third party jar dependencies.
